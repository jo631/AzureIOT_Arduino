AzureIOT_Arduino
==================

#### MCU : Arduino UNO WIFI R2 Board
>Connectivity : WiFi (Arduino WiFi Header : WiFiNINA )  
>Memory(Very Few) -> Flash : 48KB | SRAM : 6KB | EEPROM : 256KB   

The reason why I adopted Azure is because the headers used in the AWS example are because they can take a lot of memory.  
The headers were very limited because they had only 6kb of SRAM.
